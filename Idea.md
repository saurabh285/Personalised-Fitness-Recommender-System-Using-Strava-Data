# 🚴‍♂️🏃‍♀️ Personalized Fitness Recommender System Using Strava Data

## 🎯 Why is this useful for everyone?

- Everyone struggles with optimizing their workouts for best results—often following generic routines.
- Personalized recommendations help users achieve fitness goals faster, reduce injuries, and stay motivated.
- Demonstrates clear, real-world application of recommender system techniques.

## 🌟 Project Overview:

This project analyzes historical Strava workout data (runs, rides, swims, etc.) and utilizes a recommender system to generate personalized, data-driven workout suggestions based on your unique fitness habits, goals, and past performance.

## 🔥 Key Features:

### 1. Workout Data Analysis & Visualization:

- Interactive visualizations showing workout patterns (distance, pace, frequency).
- Insights on consistency, intensity variation, and performance trends.

### 2. Personalized Workout Recommendation Engine:

- Implement collaborative filtering or content-based recommender methods to suggest new workouts.
- Recommendations based on workouts similar athletes find effective (collaborative filtering) or workouts similar to ones you've successfully completed (content-based).

### 3. Goal-Based Training Plans:

- Users set personalized fitness goals (improve speed, endurance, lose weight, etc.).
- The recommender system dynamically generates tailored workout plans aligned to these goals.

### 4. Predictive Performance Insights:

- Machine learning model predicts improvements based on recommended workouts.
- Users can visualize potential fitness progress clearly.

### 5. Intuitive Fitness Dashboard (Streamlit):

- Interactive interface displaying recommended workouts, progress tracking, and performance analytics.
- Clear visualizations generated using Plotly or Matplotlib for enhanced user experience.

## ⚙️ How the Recommender System Works:

- **Content-Based Filtering:**
  - Matches your past workouts' attributes (distance, duration, elevation gain, pace) to new workout suggestions that fit your proven preferences.

- **Collaborative Filtering:**
  - Identifies athletes with similar training habits and recommends workouts that were effective for them, leveraging the power of a fitness community's collective wisdom.

- **Hybrid Approach (optional, advanced):**
  - Combines both methods, offering personalized and community-informed recommendations for maximum effectiveness.

## 🛠️ Technologies to Use:

- **Python**
- **Streamlit** (Interactive dashboard)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (data handling and analysis)
- **Plotly/Matplotlib** (visualizations)
- **Scikit-learn** (clustering and predictive modeling)
- **Surprise or TensorFlow Recommenders** (advanced recommender implementations)
- **Strava API or CSV data exports**
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash/OpenAI GPT** (optional natural-language-based workout explanations)

## 📋 Implementation Steps:

### 1. Data Collection & Cleaning:
- Integrate with Strava API or use CSV-exported workout data.
- Clean, preprocess, and structure workout data.

### 2. Exploratory Analysis & Visualization:
- Generate visual insights on workout patterns, consistency, and performance trends.

### 3. Building the Recommender System:
- Develop a content-based filtering model (workout similarity).
- Develop a collaborative-filtering approach (user similarity).
- Evaluate accuracy using metrics like Precision@K or Mean Average Precision (MAP).

### 4. Predictive Analytics:
- Train ML models to estimate future performance based on recommended workouts.

### 5. Interactive Dashboard Development:
- Develop a user-friendly Streamlit interface for exploring recommendations, tracking progress, and viewing analytics.

## 📣 Sharing Your Insights on LinkedIn:

- **Your Motivation:**  
  “I realized the untapped potential in my Strava data, so I built an AI-driven recommender system to unlock personalized workout insights for anyone to use.”

- **Technical Insights:**
  - Clearly explain how your recommender model works, challenges you faced, and techniques used (content-based vs. collaborative filtering).

- **Interesting Findings:**
  - Share surprising insights, e.g., "I discovered I perform better during evening workouts; tailored recommendations significantly improved my performance."

- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Discuss future possibilities such as integrating real-time updates, social sharing, or extending to mobile platforms.
