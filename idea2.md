# 🏆 Personalized Fitness Recommender System

## 🚴‍♂️🏃‍♀️ Key Recommendations & Features

### 1. 🏅 Performance-Based Workout Suggestions

- **Speed Booster Run**  
  If your goal is to increase pace, suggests interval runs (e.g., 5x400m sprints at a faster pace than your current average).

- **Endurance Builder Ride**  
  If aiming for longer distances, recommends progressive long rides with steady effort.

- **Hill Training for Strength**  
  If your runs show low elevation gain, recommends hill workouts to build leg strength.

### 2. 🎯 Goal-Oriented Training Plans

- **5K Time Trial Improvement Plan**  
  Suggests progressive runs (speedwork, tempo runs, long slow distance runs) for a structured 4-week improvement.

- **Cycling for Fat Burn**  
  Suggests steady-state cycling and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) rides to enhance metabolism.

- **Triathlon Prep Plan**  
  For runners, cyclists, and swimmers, provides a balanced schedule tailored to your strengths and weaknesses.

### 3. 🔥 Recovery & Injury Prevention

- **Low-Impact Cross-Training**  
  If recent workouts have high intensity, recommends swimming, yoga, or light cycling for recovery.

- **Avoid Overtraining**  
  Warns if weekly mileage suddenly spikes, advising reduced intensity or rest days.

### 4. 🤝 Social & Community-Based Recommendations *(Collaborative Filtering)*

- **"Athletes Like You Also Tried…"**  
  If similar runners benefited from hill sprints, recommends you do the same.

- **"Trending Workouts in Your Community"**  
  Suggests workouts gaining popularity on platforms like Strava.

### 5. ⏳ Predictive Performance Insights

- **"If You Follow This Plan…"**  
  Predicts pace/finish time improvements using machine learning.

  Example: _“Following this plan, your 5K time could drop to 22:30 in 6 weeks.”_

## 🚀 Advanced Features *(Future Enhancements)*

- **Adaptive AI Recommendations:**  
  Dynamically refines suggestions as you log new workouts.

- **Natural Language Insights:**  
  Leverages Gemini 1.5 Flash or OpenAI GPT for human-readable explanations.  
  Example: _"Based on your last 5 runs, your pace drops after 3km. Try intervals to sustain speed longer!"_

- **Weather-Based Suggestions:**  
  Example: _“It’s going to rain this weekend; how about an indoor HIIT session?”_

## 📌 Recommended Technical Approach

### 🔥 Hybrid Recommender System

A Hybrid Recommender (Content-Based Filtering + Collaborative Filtering) demonstrates expertise in advanced ML approaches and solves real-world challenges (sparsity, cold-start).

#### ✅ Implementation Steps:

- **Step 1: Content-Based Filtering (CBF)**
  - Compute similarity (e.g., cosine similarity) on workout attributes.
  - Recommend workouts similar to your successful past sessions.

- **Step 2: Collaborative Filtering (CF)**
  - Utilize Matrix Factorization (SVD, ALS) or deep learning-based CF.
  - Recommend workouts based on similar athletes' success.

- **Step 3: Hybrid Model**
  - Weighted combination (e.g., 60% CBF, 40% CF).
  - Default to content-based if collaborative filtering faces a cold-start issue.

Example: _"You recently completed a 10K at 5:30 min/km. Similar athletes improved by interval training; here's a recommended 6x800m session!"_

### 📊 Predictive Performance Modeling *(Bonus)*

#### ✅ How to:

- Train predictive models (Random Forest/XGBoost) to estimate pace improvements.
- Use LSTM/ARIMA models for time-series forecasting.

Example: _"If you follow this plan, your 5K could improve from 25:00 to 23:45 in 6 weeks."_

### 📈 Interactive Streamlit Dashboard

#### ✅ Benefits:

- Demonstrates real-world AI product-building skills.
- Visualizes recommendations and performance predictions interactively.

#### ✅ Dashboard Features:

- Upload & analyze Strava data.
- Explore personalized workout recommendations.
- View predictive performance metrics.

Example: _"Here’s your best-performing workouts, next recommended training sessions, and estimated race times."_
